# Prompt: You are helping build a benchmark for evaluating vision-language models' understanding of emotion.  Task: Classify the facial expression of the person shown in an image. The emotion can be represented in three label sets: 6 basic emotions, 8 emotions, and 26 fine-grained emotions. Please generate 50 different natural instructions that ask the model to classify the emotion shown in an image, varying the phrasing while keeping the meaning the same. The instructions should be clear and specific, and avoid unnecessary complexity. Output a python array list.
